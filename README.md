# street-manager-docs

Welcome to the new Street Manager documentation repository.  This repo should be considered the primary source of truth for technical documentation relating to the DfT Street Manager service.

This repo will be updated and extended regularly, but will initially include the initial Street Manager API specification and business rules documentation.

Please contact the Street Manager team directly through email or Slack, should you have any queries or require additional support.
